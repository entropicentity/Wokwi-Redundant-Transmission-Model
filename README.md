This is a signal redundancy system.

The two switches on the left, by the "Input Signal" text control the two bits of data actually being transmitted, and you can chech their state by the LED indicators by the input green for bit 0 and blue for bit 1.

The set of 6 switches at the top controls which of the intermediary wires face distortion, which in this case is  simulated by having that signal invert. For these, left means no distortion on the line and right means distortion on the line.

The inversion that occurs when a signal is inverted can be visualised by the "intermediary signal indicator lights"

The signals then go into the logic system by the text "Signal Recombination Logic" which is able to correct for some distortion.

The resulting signal is then sent to the two indicator LEDs by the text "Final Received Signals" which are again green and  blue.

the system can handle one line out of three interfered with at a time without losing signal integrity.
